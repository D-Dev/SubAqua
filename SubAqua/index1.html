	Caribbean recipes combine African, Amerindian, French, East Indian, 
and Spanish styles of cooking. Rice is the staple of a Caribbean meal and isn't complete 
without a generous helping. It is eaten with a variety of sauces and beans. You'll find the 
rice on each island may be a little different. Some season their rice, or add peas and other 
touches - like coconut. Sometimes the rice is yellow, but other times it is part of a dish. 
Jamaican , Antiguan, Guadeloupian, and other French Caribbean islands enjoy goat meat. Goat water
stew has been chosen as the official national dish of Montserrat and is also one of the signature
dishes of St. Kitts and Nevis. It is a tomato-based stew, made with goat meat, breadfruit, green 
pawpaw (papaya), and dumplings (also known as "droppers"). Another Caribbean recipe favourite is 
called "Cook-up", or Pelau. This dish combines meats like chicken, beef, pig tail, saltfish, and vegetables with rice and pigeon peas.
Seafood is one of the most common Caribbean recipe delicacies in the islands due in part to their geographic location. Each island will likely have its own specialty. Some prepare lobster, while others prefer certain types of fish. Barbados is known for its "flying fish," while Trinidad and Tobago is known for its cascadura fish and crab.
